<h1>nuxt-vue-i-tunes-project</h1>

<h2>Server side single page app built with Nuxt JS and VueJs.<h2>

<p>User focused application that allows the user to enter their favourite music artists name in the search box, this sends a request to the I-Tunes API
and returns every album that has the User's selected artist in the album's name.</p>
<p>
Items pulled:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Artist's name
</li>
<li>
Artist's thumbnail image
</li>
<li>
Album name
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Refreshing the page transposes the user back to the search screen, clicking the returned items opens the i-tunes store for the selected item.
Instead of using the Client Side to use the http requests, the server side is utilised.
